# Day 1 Exercise 1: TDD Fizzbuzz

This exercise involves building a [Fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) function using Test-Driven Development to evolve your design iteratively. TDD gives you continuous feedback on the quality of your design whilst building confidence in your code.

## Approach

When doing this exercise, try to implement the function using tests to convince yourself that the code you have written is correct.

Implement 1 test at a time, and then write the code needed to pass the test, as per the red-green-refactor cycle.

## Functional requirements

You need to build a fizzbuzz function meeting the follwing requirements:

+ If the number is divisible by 3, return 'fizz'.
+ If the number is divisible by 5, return 'buzz'.
+ If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, return 'fizzbuzz'.
+ If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the number as a string.

## How to Work

1. Create separate files for your game code and test code (e.g. `src/fizzbuzz.ts` and `src/fizzbuzz.test.ts`.)
2. Follow the red-green-refactor cycle when developing your code.
